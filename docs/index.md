# AlephPrime Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for **AlephPrime**, a framework for Prime-Resonant Quantum Computing and its applications in Large Language Models.

## Core Library

*   **[TinyAleph Reference](reference_guide.md)**: Documentation for the core `tinyaleph` library, including Prime Hilbert Spaces, Quaternions, and Kuramoto Dynamics.
*   **[User Guide](users_guide.md)**: General user guide for getting started with the framework.

## Applications

AlephPrime includes three primary applications that leverage the core library:

### 1. Reso-LLM
A standalone, next-generation language model architecture built from the ground up on resonant principles.

*   **[Reso-LLM Reference](reso_llm_reference.md)**: Comprehensive guide to architecture, configuration, training, and inference.

### 2. LLM Fusion
A framework for grafting resonant physics layers onto existing pre-trained transformers (like GPT-2, Llama, Mistral).

*   **[LLM Fusion Reference](llm_fusion_reference.md)**: Guide to wrapping models, configuring fusion layers, and stability monitoring.

### 3. Semantic Premodel
A tool for building deterministic, prime-based semantic landscapes that serve as a foundational "prior" for the other applications.

*   **[Semantic Premodel Reference](semantic_premodel_reference.md)**: Guide to generating and refining semantic landscapes.

## Quick Links

*   **[Examples](../examples/)**: Code examples demonstrating various features.
*   **[Notebooks](../notebooks/)**: Interactive Jupyter notebooks for experimentation.
